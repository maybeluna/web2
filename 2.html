            The ultimate iPad experience. Now with breakthrough M1 performance,
            a breathtaking XDR display, and blazing‑fast 5G wireless.
            With M1, iPad Pro is the fastest device of its kind.
            It’s designed to take full advantage of next‑level performance and custom technologies like the advanced image signal processor and unified memory architecture of M1.
            And with the incredible power efficiency of M1, iPad Pro is still thin and light with all‑day battery life,
            making it as portable as it is powerful. The 8‑core CPU of M1 delivers up to 50 percent faster performance.
            And M1 has an 8‑core GPU in a class of its own, providing up to 40 percent faster graphics performance to iPad Pro.
            So you can build intricate AR models, play games with console‑quality graphics at high frame rates, and more.
            The Liquid Retina XDR display delivers true-to-life detail with a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio,
            great for viewing and editing HDR photos and videos or enjoying your favorite movies and TV shows.
            It also features a breathtaking 1000 nits of full‑screen brightness and 1600 nits of peak brightness.
            And advanced display technologies like P3 wide color, True Tone, and ProMotion.
            Over 10,000 mini‑LEDs are grouped into more than 2500 local dimming zones.
            Depending on the content, the brightness in each zone can be precisely adjusted to achieve an astonishing 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio.
            Even the most detailed HDR content with the finest specular highlights — like galaxies and action movie explosions — are more true to life than ever.
            The Liquid Retina display on the 11‑inch iPad Pro is not only gorgeous and portable, it also features incredibly advanced technologies.
            Like ProMotion, True Tone, P3 wide color, and ultralow reflectivity, which make everything feel responsive and look stunning.
            iPad has always been uniquely portable with superfast Wi‑Fi and cellular options.
            Now with 5G capabilities, you can connect to the fastest wireless networks when you need to download files, stream movies, collaborate with colleagues, and upload content on the go.
            And iPad Pro has the most 5G bands of any device of its kind — so it can get 5G in more places.
