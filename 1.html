        <h2>Lenovo ThinkPad</h2>
        <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/thinkpad"><img src="Lenovo.jpg" width="50%"></a>
        <p>The way we compute. The way we do business.
          The way we live our lives. Every time business has gone somewhere new, discovered something different, or done something revolutionary, chances are, ThinkPad was there.
          We stem from a long tradition of firsts. You’re not tethered to your desk, so it’s great to have a PC that doesn’t act like it.
          Our Yoga 2-in-1 laptops go where you go, work the way you want, and deliver heavyweight performance in a lightweight chassis. The 360-degree hinge accommodates the way you work.
          We’ve engineered Intelligent Cooling Engines into our PCs to prevent overheating and to ensure a quieter experience.
          With ThinkPad, sensors detect how the laptops are being used—whether it’s on your lap or a desk determines just how hot the system can run.
          And Intelligent Cooling also ensures a quieter and more reliable experience.
          With a ThinkPad, you don’t need to use sticky notes or tape to shield the webcam—with just the flick of a finger, you can open or close the ThinkShutter to keep your business your business.
          Our portfolio has the largest percentage of products with a camera shutter included. ThinkPad systems are engineered for durability.
          We know your business depends on your PC to keep you going. So every ThinkPad is made to endure. Nobody has time for system downtime.
          That’s why our ThinkPad laptops undergo stringent MIL-SPEC testing and hundreds of quality checks to ensure durability.
          From Artic wilderness to desert dust storms, from zero-gravity to spills and drops, you can trust they’ll handle whatever life throws your way.
          More than anything, you need to be able to rely on your device—especially when you’re on the go. Who has time to search for power outlets?
          That’s why our devices are renowned for epic battery life. Yet when you do need more juice, Rapid Charge will get you back to 80% over a lunch break.
          That’s why we created ThinkShield, an integrated suite of security features that deliver seamless protection to your system and your assets.
          Whether it’s a display that alerts you to prying eyes, biometrics to log you in, detection of WiFi network spoofing, or firmware that encrypts your data, we’ve got you covered.
          To best serve our customers, we focus on process improvement, ergonomics, and usability—so you can focus on achieving results for your business.
          The ThinkPad X1 Fold is the world’s first foldable PC: open and close it like a book, or lay it flat for a 13.3” OLED display.
          And with optional 4G or 5G built in, you can connect anywhere, anytime, with or without WiFi.
          Did you know that the TrackPoint, which appears in the center of every ThinkPad, saves your hand from reaching for a mouse and moving nearly the distance of an Olympic swimming pool over the course of a single day?
          Most of our ThinkPad laptops include dual-array, noise-cancelling, far-field mics for crystal clear audio experience. Whether you’re on a call or watching a video, you’ll enjoy high fidelity. We also offer the Dolby Atmos® Speaker System on our latest ThinkPads, for an amazing listening experience.
