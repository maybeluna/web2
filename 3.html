          Plus 8K Video Snap lets you pull an album of crisp photos—up to 33MP—right out of every 8K video. Just record now, snap later.
          S Pen compatibility means you can finesse and fine-tune while editing your videos down to the last frame, with precision that your finger simply can't touch.
          Activate Super Steady and Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G turns into an action-ready steady cam, softening the bumps and delivering silky-smooth video when you're on the move.
